# AUGMENTED REALITY WIRELESS NETWORK SECURITY MAPPER
An AR/VR/XR application made within a Unity Engine that will Map out wireless network connections to visualize signal strengths, access points, vulnerabilities, and more coming soon. Development was on the Meta Quest/ Meta Quest 2, however, applications with Android-supported AR/VR headsets should be supported. Some Code is supported with Windows Machines such as Apple Vision Pro but not fully tested.
(My Stetson University Senior Research Project for the year 2023 Fall- Spring 2024)

 
 Some Commands:
- netsh wlan show profiles
- netsh wlan show interface
	
 Some Plugins: 
- MRTK Toolkit
- Andriod Unity Engine

		- Allow the user to grab ancor and adjust it 
			- This is incase the VR adjusts or resets user's position. 
		- Have these anchors be storeable
			- Have text editing for these prefabs
	- Add the following functions to Anchor
		- Delete Anchor button to delete all prefabs
		- Activate button when changing Anchors 
		- Ability to move the anchor only on the X & Y axis

# Step 10 plans
	- Double check bugs and unneeded code	
	- Create an AR Slider for Delete Radius Button to increase size
	- Lookinto Object MRTK manipulator script
	- Detect rouge access points 
		- Add these rogue access points to AR screen
		- when scans, checks if access points SSID matches any known rogue AP SSIDs.
		- If there are new ones, pop up the window
		- create a new prefab for those rouge access points
			- possibly create a larger radius
			- prefab should have no interference with scripts of wifi objects.

		
# Step ? Plans
	- Create Save button for mapping
	- Work on saving flat image of mapped area
		-First need to make the camera that can see everything
			- Make a camera renderer that can move with player
			- Have a small screen that user can see what the camera sees
			- Use render textures 
		- Second have what the camera sees save as an image
			- Make sure that the camera can see all objects
			- Make sure it works on multiple floors (possibly a angle view)
			- Save into temp file
		- third export to the headset as an image it can open
			- Build settings have access to downloading files
			- export as Jpeg conversion
			- Saves multiple names (possibly change name with text area?)
		
# Step ? Plans
	- Save objects layout when logging off or switching
		- first, find a way to save scene
			- Save position/direction that previous was looking
			- When in that position, recreate all objects
			- Reload save
		- Second, find a way to save all objects
			- Save all locations of (x,y,z) cords of objects
			- Save data of those prefabs 
		- When log off or shut down, reloading saves all locations 

# Step ? Plans
	- Add a button or UI to let user create their own cubes for info
		- The custom cube can hold info such as room number and etc. 
	- Have a delete button on the wifi pillars
	- Change splash screen

# Cybersecuirty Ideas

	- Packet Sniffing - Less possible
	- Historic Log Organization - Less possible

	- Simulate Network Traffic - possible
	- Simulate firewall - possible
	- Simulate Shadow IT - possible
	- Mac Adress Filtering - possible
