# AUGMENTED REALITY WIRELESS NETWORK SECURITY MAPPER
 My Senior Research Project for the year 2023 Fall- Spring 2024. It is going to use AR in the unity engine. 
 Some Commands:
	- netsh wlan show profiles
	- netsh wlan show interface

# Step 0 Plans (Augest 2023)
	- ðŸ—¸ Activate Passthrough mdoe / AR - Finished
	- ðŸ—¸ Test Unity Webservices - Testing Process
	- ðŸ—¸ Get Hand Tracking to operate - Finished
	- ðŸ—¸ Get Developer Acess - RSA Finger Print Finished
	
# Step 1 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Build APK Files for Wireless AR - FINISHED
	- ðŸ—¸ WIFI Engines added for detecting nearby signals  - Quest 2 Shows SSID
	- ðŸ—¸ Custom Marking Code that marks WIFI Strengths: - COMPLETED
		- ðŸ—¸ No Signal = Red | -67dbm is Good signal (Max bars)
		- ðŸ—¸ Weak Signal = Yellow | -68dbm to -79dbm is Okay signal (Half Bars)
		- ðŸ—¸ Strong Signal = Green | -80dbm or lower is Very poor signal (Single or SOS bars)
		
# Step 2 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Get Recording with passthrough enabled - OBS/Wireless Computer (Not possible on quest 2) Wired Recording
	- ðŸ—¸ Have Flags or Tracking Color Floor based on signal
		- ðŸ—¸ Find a way to create a cube in the exact spot that the wifi connection is updated - CUBES SPAWN
		- ðŸ—¸ Create the cube's color based on the wifi connection - Wifi Points are Created based on dBs
		- ðŸ—¸ Have a radius possibly for the cubes to prevent to many being created - Prevents Cubes spawning within 2ft
	- ðŸ—¸ Get netgear router to purposly to show unsecure authencation - DONE

# Step 3 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Have it display the wifi scuirty to connected router.
	- ðŸ—¸ If authencation type is bad, give a alert to the cube being made.
		- ðŸ—¸ 0 = Open or None = !!!!!DANGER!!!!! | Red
		- ðŸ—¸ 1 = Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) = !!! HIGH ALERT !!! | Yellow
		- ðŸ—¸ 2 = Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) = @ Secure @  | Green
		- ðŸ—¸ 3 = Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) = #Protected# | Blue

# Step 4 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Have the Marked down cubes display information
		-  ðŸ—¸ When cubed is touched, have it display previous data - Displays SSID BSSID and dBm when cube was created
	- ðŸ—¸ Possibly show the range of the cube that was created wiht new prefab. 
	- ðŸ—¸ Accident: Have program test if wifi/router has access to Better secuirty | (NEEDS MORE TESTING)
		- ðŸ—¸ EX: Router is set to no security, but it still is able to check if it can have wpa2

# Step 5 Plans (January 2024)
	- ðŸ—¸ Make New prefabs of Cubes to be Wifi Pillars
		- ðŸ—¸ Have a radius transparcy
		- ðŸ—¸ Change height of pillar based on dBm signal
		- ðŸ—¸ Still have a cube on top that displays data
		- ðŸ—¸ Keep other old properties
		- ðŸ—¸ Depending on secuirty, create a symbol on top
		- ðŸ—¸ Make small background for Debug Text.
		- ðŸ—¸ Change color hex code based on signal. 
	- ðŸ—¸ Increase the rate of the cubes
	- ðŸ—¸ Have a button on the Prefab to delete itself. 
		- ðŸ—¸ Small button on bottom of Prefab to set for false for now
	
	
# Step 6 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Has data display in a AR-hud so position does not matter and better layout
		- ðŸ—¸ add enough transparency 
		- ðŸ—¸ Remake a grid layout for better visualization
		- ðŸ—¸ Add Have the following display
			- ðŸ—¸ Both netwokr security and potential network secuirty
			- ðŸ—¸ Transmit Rate + Recieve Rate
			- ðŸ—¸ add this to prefab
	- Create a data base of current properties of each scan for wifi network
		- ðŸ—¸ Make a new hud that will say the following
			- ðŸ—¸ New button on top tab to switch screens
			- ðŸ—¸ (Network SSID + Network BSSID)
				- ðŸ—¸ Good signal = int 
				- ðŸ—¸ Ok Signal = int
				- ðŸ—¸ Bad Signal = int
				- ðŸ—¸ Secure = int
				- ðŸ—¸ VUlnerable = int
			- ðŸ—¸ New network...
		- Create Script that keeps the DataBase updating
			- ðŸ—¸ Create Dictionary that keeps each data of network
			- Create new visual each new network joining
			- Make sure No_Connection is included to the previous network
	- Create a button that delete wifiobjects on click
		- Have radius adjustment for user.
		- Get rid of all wifi objects within radius
	- ðŸ—¸ SPEEL CHECK
		
# Step 7 Plans
	
	- ðŸ—¸ Create Prefabs name based on SSID
	- ðŸ—¸ IF change to new SSID, set all objects to false
		- ðŸ—¸ If changed back reverse the true and false condition
	- ðŸ—¸ This will be to mimic saving for future functions. 
		- ðŸ—¸ If no connection, defualt to previous SSID
	- Mimic Finding Shadow ITs Networks that are hidden
		- Detect Hidden SSIDs when scanning
			- Create new screen in AR
			- Make script for popup for new SSID
				- Ask if it's white or black listed
		- Have SSIDs become white or black listed
		- Detect rouge access points 
			- Add these rouge access points to AR screen
			- when scans, checks if access points SSID matches any known rogue AP SSIDs.

# Step 8 Plans
	- Create an Anchor point that the prefabs spawn locations are based
		- LOOK INTO ARCORE XR Plugin: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arcore@4.1/manual/index.html
		- Have a button to drop an anchor
		- Allow the user to grab ancor and adjust it 
			- This is incase the VR adjusts or resets user's position. 
		- Have these anchors be storeable
			- Have text editing for these prefabs
	- Add the following functions to Anchor
		- Delete Anchor button to delete all prefabs
		- Ability to move the anchor only on the X & Y axis
			- Make sure Rotation is locked to avoid slanted objects
		- A button to press to edit text
			- Store the anchor within user's data
	- Can anchors be inside of anchors? 
			
		
		
# Step ? Plans
	- Create Save button for mapping
	- Work on saving flat image of mapped area
		-First need to make the camera that can see everything
			- Make a camera renderer that can move with player
			- Have a small screen that user can see what the camera sees
			- Use render textures 
		- Second have what the camera sees save as an image
			- Make sure that the camera can see all objects
			- Make sure it works on multiple floors (possibly a angle view)
			- Save into temp file
		- third export to the headset as an image it can open
			- Build settings have access to downloading files
			- export as Jpeg conversion
			- Saves multiple names (possibly change name with text area?)
		
# Step ? Plans
	- Save objects layout when logging off or switching
		- first, find a way to save scene
			- Save position/direction that previous was looking
			- When in that position, recreate all objects
			- Reload save
		- Second, find a way to save all objects
			- Save all locations of (x,y,z) cords of objects
			- Save data of those prefabs 
		- When log off or shut down, reloading saves all locations 

# Step ? Plans
	- Add a button or UI to let user create their own cubes for info
		- The custom cube can hold info such as room number and etc. 
	- Have a delete button on the wifi pillars
	- Change splash screen 
	- If a new access point is created (BSSID), make a pillar to mark it.

# APK Versions
	- APK 1: Testing Mixed Reality 
	- APK 2: Getting SSID
	- APK 3: Getting SSID + BSSID
	- APK 4: Getting SSID + BSSID + RSSI/Signal
	- APK 5: Takes all 3 and makes prefabs base on location
	- APK 6: Added Auth/Secuirty Detection
	- APK 7: debugging Auth/Secuirty Detection
	- APK 8: New Prefabs + New Screen
	- APK 9: ...
	
# Cybersecuirty Ideas

	- Packet Sniffing - Less possible
	- Historic Log Organization - Less possible

	- Simulate Network Traffic - possible
	- Simulate firewall - possible
	- Simulate Shadow IT - possible
	- Mac Adress Filtering - possible
	
	- Shadow IT function - possible
		- Rogue Access Point Detection - Very possible
		- Detect Hidden SSID networks - Very possible
