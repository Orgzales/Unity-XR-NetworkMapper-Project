# AUGMENTED REALITY WIRELESS NETWORK SECURITY MAPPER
An AR/VR/XR application made within a Unity Engine that will Map out wireless network connections to visualize signal strengths, access points, vulnerabilities, and more coming soon. Development was on the Meta Quest/ Meta Quest 2, however, applications with Android-supported AR/VR headsets should be supported. Some Code is supported with Windows Machines such as Apple Vision Pro but not fully tested.

	- ðŸ—¸ Create a data base of current properties of each scan for wifi network
		- ðŸ—¸ Make a new hud that will say the following
			- ðŸ—¸ New button on top tab to switch screens
			- ðŸ—¸ (Network SSID + Network BSSID)
				- ðŸ—¸ Good signal = int 
				- ðŸ—¸ Ok Signal = int
				- ðŸ—¸ Bad Signal = int
				- ðŸ—¸ Secure = int
				- ðŸ—¸ VUlnerable = int
			- ðŸ—¸ New network...
		- ðŸ—¸ Create Script that keeps the DataBase updating
			- ðŸ—¸ Create Dictionary that keeps each data of network
			- ðŸ—¸ Make sure No_Connection is included to the previous network
	- ðŸ—¸ make new prefab for BSSID connection
		- ðŸ—¸ Same SSID but DIFFERENT BSSID = New Pillars
		- ðŸ—¸ Create the new prefab 
		- ðŸ—¸ text should always be showing
			- ðŸ—¸ text = previous bssid -> new bssid 
		- ðŸ—¸ should not be created when first connection

		- Create larger creation radius 
		- Timer till creation 
		
# Step 8 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Create Prefabs name based on SSID
	- ðŸ—¸ IF change to new SSID, set all objects to false
		- ðŸ—¸ If changed back reverse the true and false condition
	- ðŸ—¸ This will be to mimic saving for future functions. 
		- ðŸ—¸ If no connection, defualt to previous SSID
	- Mimic Finding Shadow ITs Networks that are hidden
		- Detect Hidden SSIDs when scanning

		- Have SSIDs become white or black listed
	- Create a button that repeats the Shadow IT scan
		- Detect rouge access points 
			- Add these rogue access points to AR screen
			- when scans, checks if access points SSID matches any known rogue AP SSIDs.
			- If there are new ones, pop up the window
			- create a new prefab for those rouge access points
				- possibly create a larger radius
				- prefab should have no interference with scripts of wifi objects.
	- Create an AR Slider for Delete Radius Button to increase size

# Step 9 Plans
	- Create an Anchor point that the prefabs spawn locations are based
		- LOOK INTO ARCORE XR Plugin: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arcore@4.1/manual/index.html
		- Have a button to drop an anchor 
		- Allow the user to grab ancor and adjust it 
			- This is incase the VR adjusts or resets user's position. 
		- Have these anchors be storeable
			- Have text editing for these prefabs
	- Add the following functions to Anchor
		- Delete Anchor button to delete all prefabs
		- Ability to move the anchor only on the X & Y axis
			- Make sure Rotation is locked to avoid slanted objects
		- A button to press to edit text
			- Store the anchor within user's data
	- Can anchors be inside of anchors? 
			
		
		
# Step ? Plans
	- Create Save button for mapping
	- Work on saving flat image of mapped area
		-First need to make the camera that can see everything
			- Make a camera renderer that can move with player
			- Have a small screen that user can see what the camera sees
			- Use render textures 
		- Second have what the camera sees save as an image
			- Make sure that the camera can see all objects
			- Make sure it works on multiple floors (possibly a angle view)
			- Save into temp file
		- third export to the headset as an image it can open
			- Build settings have access to downloading files
			- export as Jpeg conversion
			- Saves multiple names (possibly change name with text area?)
		
# Step ? Plans
	- Save objects layout when logging off or switching
		- first, find a way to save scene
			- Save position/direction that previous was looking
			- When in that position, recreate all objects
			- Reload save
		- Second, find a way to save all objects
			- Save all locations of (x,y,z) cords of objects
			- Save data of those prefabs 
		- When log off or shut down, reloading saves all locations 

# Step ? Plans
	- Add a button or UI to let user create their own cubes for info
		- The custom cube can hold info such as room number and etc. 
	- Have a delete button on the wifi pillars
	- Change splash screen 
	- If a new access point is created (BSSID), make a pillar to mark it.

# Cybersecuirty Ideas

	- Packet Sniffing - Less possible
	- Historic Log Organization - Less possible

	- Simulate Network Traffic - possible
	- Simulate firewall - possible
	- Simulate Shadow IT - possible
	- Mac Adress Filtering - possible
	
	- Shadow IT function - possible
		- Rogue Access Point Detection - Very possible
		- Detect Hidden SSID networks - Very possible
