# OX-r TRAIL (AUGMENTED REALITY WIRELESS NETWORK SECURITY MAPPER)
An AR/VR/XR application made within a Unity Engine that will Map out wireless network connections to visualize signal strengths, access points, vulnerabilities, and more coming soon. Development was on the Meta Quest/ Meta Quest 2, however, applications with Android-supported AR/VR headsets should be supported. Some Code is supported with Windows Machines such as Apple Vision Pro but not fully tested.

### Method For Start of ShadowITScan
```ruby
    private IEnumerator ScanForHiddenSSIDs()
    {
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(1.0f);

        AndroidJavaObject activity = new AndroidJavaClass("com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer").GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject>("currentActivity");
        AndroidJavaObject wifiManager = activity.Call<AndroidJavaObject>("getSystemService", "wifi");
        wifiManager.Call<bool>("startScan"); //works for restarting scan
        AndroidJavaObject scanResults = wifiManager.Call<AndroidJavaObject>("getScanResults");

        int scanResultsCount = scanResults.Call<int>("size");
        int hiddenFound = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < scanResultsCount; i++)
        {
            AndroidJavaObject scanResult = scanResults.Call<AndroidJavaObject>("get", i);
            string ssid = scanResult.Get<string>("SSID");
            int signalStrength = scanResult.Get<int>("level"); //works

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(ssid)) //For Rouge or unnamed ssid networks 
            {
                ssid = "Hidden/NoName SSID Found #" + hiddenFound.ToString();
                hiddenFound++;
            }

            string SSIDInfo = ssid + " (" + signalStrength.ToString() + " dBm)";

            if (!allSSIDs.Contains(ssid))
            {
                allSSIDs.Add(ssid);
                CurrentSSID = ssid;
                SSIDSignal[ssid] = signalStrength;
                ShowPopup(SSIDInfo);
                yield return new WaitUntil(() => popupClosed);
                popupClosed = false; // Reset
            }

        }
        Other_Spawner_ManagerScript.SpawnShadowITPrefab(); //makes new prefab
        NoActiveScanning = true; //Scanning ends here when prefab is created
        SetWhiteText();
        SetBlackText();
        InvokeRepeating("UpdateSignals", 2.0f, 6.0f);
    }
```


## Step 9 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Fix Shadow Prefab Delte Bug
	- ðŸ—¸ Fix StartCourtine Bug
		- ðŸ—¸ List and Dictionary should clear each scan
		- ðŸ—¸ Update the text of the Screen after scan if finished
		- ðŸ—¸ Set all important varaibles when button is press not during scan
	- ðŸ—¸ Add signal strength tracking on hidden ssids scan 
		- ðŸ—¸ Have each one colorized based on dBm
		- ðŸ—¸ Add signal Str to shadow Prefab
		- ðŸ—¸ add a tracking function within Shadow Scan function to keep updated signals 
			- ðŸ—¸ When user travels, the function updates the scan signals  
			- ðŸ—¸ When the user rescans the hidden SSIDs, the scan should stop to prevent crashes
			- ðŸ—¸ Update the database screen when the function repeats 
			- ðŸ—¸ If new SSID or HIDDEN SSID is detected notify the user 
			- ðŸ—¸ if a SSID within the list of tracking and there is no signal update the signal to -999
			- ðŸ—¸ Repeat this for Demo Mode 
				- ðŸ—¸ Add in a random function to mimic a new network detected 
			- ðŸ—¸ Change color of dBm based on new Hidden SSID and no signal to be more noticable
	- ðŸ—¸ During Shadow SSID Scan, if a network with no ssid is detected or found, rename it to "Hidden Network Found" 
	- ðŸ—¸ Get Wifi Pineapple configured to see if mimicing networking risk can be detected
		- ðŸ—¸ Test with same SSID as Stetson vs Stetson Named SSID
		- Record Results of VR application w/ Wifi_Pineapple + NETGEAR
	- ðŸ—¸ Make a seperate manager script that handles all other non-connection strength prefab spawns.
		- ðŸ—¸ Shadow IT Prefab
		-  Regular Anchor Prefab
	
### ReScanning Hidden SSID AndriodJavaObjects
```ruby
AndroidJavaObject activity = new AndroidJavaClass("com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer").GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject>("currentActivity");
AndroidJavaObject wifiManager = activity.Call<AndroidJavaObject>("getSystemService", "wifi");
wifiManager.Call<bool>("startScan"); //works for restarting scan
AndroidJavaObject scanResults = wifiManager.Call<AndroidJavaObject>("getScanResults");
int scanResultsCount = scanResults.Call<int>("size");
```

## Step 10 plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Create an Anchor point that the prefabs spawn locations are based
		- ðŸ—¸ Install ARCORE XR Plugin
		- ðŸ—¸ Create Anchor Prefab
			- ðŸ—¸ Each Anchor should have different name
			- ðŸ—¸ Anchor should have ability to be deleted with each isntance within 
			- ðŸ—¸ Not being affected by the override or delete commands 
		- ðŸ—¸ Have a button to drop an anchor 
		- ðŸ—¸ Allow the user to grab ancor and adjust it 
			- ðŸ—¸ This is incase the VR adjusts or resets user's position. 
		- ðŸ—¸ Have these anchors be storeable
			- ðŸ—¸ Have the Wifi Scans, Bssid Scans, or Shadow Scans within hierarchy 
			- ðŸ—¸ When a new Anchor is set, it should automatically become the new Origin for scans
			- ðŸ—¸ Anchors should not switch between networks
				- ðŸ—¸ Example: User places anchor in roomA with WifiA
				- ðŸ—¸ User scans with Wifi A, then switches network to WifiB
				- ðŸ—¸ The anchor would continue to store wifi maps on both networks 
				- ðŸ—¸ When the user shrinks the anchor to see full map, switching networks would adjust to same size aswell.
	- ðŸ—¸ Add the following functions to Anchor
		- ðŸ—¸ Delete Anchor button to delete all prefabs
		- ðŸ—¸ Activate button to change which Anchor you would use
			- ðŸ—¸ Text should change when Anchor is active or not
			- ðŸ—¸ Wifi Scans woul switch to the anchor that has been activated
		- ðŸ—¸ Ability to move the anchor only on the X & Y axis
			- ðŸ—¸ Make sure Rotation is locked to avoid slanted objects
			- ðŸ—¸ Size of anchors can be modified. 
	- ðŸ—¸ Can anchors be inside of anchors? 
		- ðŸ—¸ Technically yes but for now gonna attempt to avoid that. 
	- ðŸ—¸ Have the user be able to shrink and adjust of whole mapped out anchor
		- ðŸ—¸ This could allow the impressive display within the AR enviroment
		- ðŸ—¸ Easier to export photos and videos built into the VR functions
	- ðŸ—¸ Make Origin Anchor not able to be deleted
		- ðŸ—¸ If Current Active Anchor is Deleted, the program will default to the Origin Anchor.
		
## Step 11 Plans
	- ðŸ—¸ Clean Up Scene 1
		- ðŸ—¸ Keep Scene 0 as Backup 
	- ðŸ—¸ FIX BSSID Bug. 
	- ðŸ—¸ FIX WHITE + BLACK LIST BUG. 
	- ðŸ—¸ Make custom script to turn Diagnostics off
	-  Double check bugs and clean unneeded code	
	- ðŸ—¸ Make and Change splash screen 
	- ðŸ—¸ Add LOGO to Popup Screen 
	- Make a new Tutorial/info Screen about OXr Trail
		- One Screen should display what the program does
		- Second Screen should explain button controls
	- Readjust all prefabs in opening scene
	- Find out how to make popup logs in the quest 2 manager 
	

## Step 12 Plans
	-  Finish Research Paper + Presentation Video Field Testing 
	-  If there is time will continue the rest in this step 
	-  Add a button or UI to let user create their own cubes for info
		-  The custom cube can hold info such as room number and etc. 
	-  Save objects layout when logging off or switching
		-  first, find a way to save scene
			-  Save position/direction that previous was looking
			-  When in that position, recreate all objects
			-  Reload save
		-  Second, find a way to save all objects
			-  Save all locations of (x,y,z) cords of objects
			-  Save data of those prefabs 
		-  When log off or shut down, reloading saves all locations
